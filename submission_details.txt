Changes in netspec
I added conv_4, bn_4, and relu_4 to the base modelâ€™s netspec. It has the most number of filters (128) as it is the deepest layer to capture more sophisticated features.

Data Augmentation
Random crop and mirroring 

Randomized Crop
I cropped each of the 32,000 original images in the training set using transforms.RandomResizedCrop().

Mirroring
I flipped each of the 32,000 original images (not the cropped images) using transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip().

Training Policy
I only changed the step_size of the training policy. I noticed the validation accuracy was getting higher (~62%) around epoch 10 in all of my tests, so I set step size to that epoch to better capture the validation accuracy there.

Results
This model resulted in ~62% validation accuracy in epochs 11-25. Here is the final epoch result:
[25/25: tr_loss 0.7928 val_loss 1.148 t_acc 74.33% val_acc 62.62%]
